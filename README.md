# Express Library App

This is a simple library management application built with Express.js and Mongoose.

## Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/): An elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- [Pug](https://pugjs.org/): A high-performance template engine heavily influenced by Haml and implemented with JavaScript for Node.js and browsers.
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/): A utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server.
- [Express Async Handler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-async-handler): A middleware for handling exceptions inside of async express routes and passing them to your express error handlers.
- [Express Validator](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/): An express.js middleware for validator.js.
- [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/): A collection of 14 smaller middleware functions that set HTTP response headers.
- [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/): A powerful, modern, and friendly wrapper for Javascript dates and times.
- [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv): A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- [Express Rate Limit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit): Basic rate-limiting middleware for Express that slows down responses rather than blocking them outright.
- [Morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan): HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js.
- [Cookie Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser): Parse `Cookie` header and populate `req.cookies` with an object keyed by the cookie names.
- [Debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug): A tiny JavaScript debugging utility modelled after Node.js core's debugging technique.
- [HTTP Errors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-errors): Create HTTP error objects.
- [Compression](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression): Node.js compression middleware.
